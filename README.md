  ## Description
  A blog where developers and students can post articles on tech related news, developments, or anything that they wish to post. Users can create an account and add posts to the site via the Dashboard. Users can then edit or delete posts to their liking. If you wish to view others posts, users have the ability to leave comments to the posts as well! This app was built with express, mysql, sequelize, and handlebars.js for the page formatting.
